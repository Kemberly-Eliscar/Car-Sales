// STEP 3 - connecting components
// Call the connect function twice (curry) and pass in the component
// to the second call

// The first call takes in two arguments:
// 1- function (usually called mapStateToProps (mSTP))
// 2- an object that takes in action creators, and wraps them in the dispatch function and passes them on to props
